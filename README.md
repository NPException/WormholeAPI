# WormholeAPI

##CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, DO NOT USE YET

This is the Wormhole API created by *Davenonymous*, *Jezza* and *NPException*.

It is a simple way for Minecraft mods to interact with both: [Compact Machines](https://github.com/thraaawn/CompactMachines) and [Dimensional Pockets](https://github.com/NPException42/Dimensional-Pockets) (and of course all other mods that might implement the central IWormhole interface).

For us as the developers of CM and DP it is kind of hard to make certain mods work with our blocks, and sometimes either hacky or performance heavy, or the results might not be as a player would naturally expect.

So when [SoniEx2](https://github.com/SoniEx2) made a pull request with an idea for an API to Compact Machines, we stuck our heads together and designed this API, so mods can chose to do the fancy stuff on their own. We provide an easy way for them to get the data they might need to use.
